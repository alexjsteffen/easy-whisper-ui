## üçé Initial macOS Support

Thanks to the incredible contribution from [celerycoloured](https://github.com/celerycoloured), EasyWhisper UI now runs on macOS! 
Check it out on the `releases` page. 

## Features
- Supports translation for 100+ languages.
- Supports batch processing ‚Äî drag in multiple files or select many at once; they transcribe one by one in a queue.
- Installer handles everything for you ‚Äî from downloading dependencies to compiling/optimizing Whisper for your specific hardware.
- Choice of `.txt` files, or `.srt` files with timestamps!
- Fully C++ implementation ‚Äî no Python!
- Uses Vulkan API for cross-platform GPU acceleration!
- Uses Metal API for GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon on MacOS!
- Drag & drop or use ‚ÄúOpen With‚Äù to load media.
- Automatically converts media to `.mp3` if needed using FFmpeg.
- Dropdown menu to select the model (e.g. `tiny`, `medium-en`, `large-v3`).
- Dropdown to select language (e.g. `en` for English).
- Textbox for additional arguments.
- Automatically downloads the chosen model if missing.
- Shows all output in a console box.
- Opens final transcript in Notepad.

## Build Steps (I RECOMMEND YOU USE THE INSTALLER AVOVE)

1. **Install [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools)**  
   ‚Äì Use a kit with a compatible C++ compiler (e.g. MinGW).
2. **Install [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)**  
   ‚Äì Required to build the installer.
3. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehtabmahir/easy-whisper-ui.git
   ```
4. **Open `CMakeLists.txt` in Qt Creator**  
   ‚Äì Located in the root of the cloned folder.
5. **Use a build kit with a C++ compiler and CMake**
6. **Build the project**  
   ‚Äì Press `Ctrl + B` or click the Build button.
7. Installer and build will be in `build\Installer` and `build\Final` respectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Setup (No Installer)

If you prefer not to use the one-click installer for whatever reason, you can manually set up **EasyWhisper UI** by following these steps:

### 1. **Get the UI Executable**
You can either:
- Build it yourself (see the [Build](#build) section), **or**
- Download the latest prebuilt [`EasyWhisperUI.exe`](https://github.com/mehtabmahir/easy-whisper-ui/releases)

### 2. **Bundle Qt DLLs**
If you downloaded the standalone `EasyWhisperUI.exe`, use `windeployqt` from `Qt Creator` to gather the required Qt runtime DLLs:
```bash
windeployqt EasyWhisperUI.exe
```
You can find `windeployqt` in your Qt Creator install directory.

### 3. **Get whisper.cpp**
- Clone the official [`whisper.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) repository
- Compile it using CMake and a compatible compiler (e.g. MSVC or mingw64):
```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release -j8
```

### 4. **Copy the CLI Binary**
After building, copy the `whisper-cli.exe` (from the `build/Release` folder) into the same folder as `EasyWhisperUI.exe`.

Once all files are in place, just run `EasyWhisperUI.exe` to get started. No installation required!
